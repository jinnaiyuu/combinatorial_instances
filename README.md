# Benchmark Instances

This is a repository for combinatorial search domain instances.
15-puzzle, 24-puzzle, grid-pathfinding, travelling salesperson problem (TSP), and multiple sequence alignment (MSA).

15-puzzle includes randomly generated instances and Korf's puzzle.
24-puzzle includes randomly generated instances.
Grid-pathfinding is randomly generated.
TSP is randomly generated.
Multiple sequence alignment includes randomly generated instances and real aminos from BAliBASE 3.0.

# Instance generators

Instance generators are in *-gen directories.
Generators for Sliding-tile puzzle and grid-pathfinding are coded by the PBNF authors.
Yuu Jinnai coded TSP and MSA.
